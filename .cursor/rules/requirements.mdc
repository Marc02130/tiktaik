# Requirements Standards

## Core Principles

1. Requirements Location
- All requirements MUST be in docs/ folder
- Files MUST be prefixed with "req-"
- Example: docs/req-video-upload.md

2. Requirements Verification
- Check docs/req/req-* files before implementation
- If no requirements exist:
  - Ask for requirements
  - Wait for requirements documentation
  - Do not proceed without requirements
- If requirements conflict:
  - Ask for clarification
  - Do not proceed until conflicts resolved
  - Document resolution in requirements

3. Requirements Format
```markdown
# Feature Name

## User Requirements
- User-facing requirements
- Acceptance criteria
- UI/UX specifications

## Technical Requirements
- Implementation details
- Data structures
- API specifications
- Performance criteria
```

4. Implementation Rules
- MUST verify requirements before coding
- MUST implement according to requirements
- MUST NOT add undocumented features
- MUST request requirements update for changes
- MUST ask for clarification on conflicts
- MUST wait for conflict resolution before proceeding

5. Documentation
```swift
// Required - Reference requirements
/// Implementation of req-feature-name.md
/// See: docs/req-feature-name.md#section
```

## Examples

Good:
```swift
/// Implementation of req-comments.md
/// See: docs/req-comments.md#error-handling
enum CommentError: Error {
    // Implements required error cases
}
```

Bad:
```swift
// Missing requirements reference
enum CommentError: Error {
    // Unknown if these match requirements
}
```
