# Bug Fixing Standards

1. Core Principles
   - NEVER delete functionality when fixing a bug
   - Fix bugs by correcting implementation, not removing features
   - Document all changes with clear explanations
   - Test fixes thoroughly before committing

2. Context Requirements
   MUST check before requesting files:
   - Review error messages and stack traces
   - Check provided code snippets
   - Review related cursor rules
   - Look for file paths in logs
   
3. File Request Protocol
   When requesting files:
   - Explain why the file is needed
   - Reference the specific error/issue
   - List what was checked first
   - Quote relevant error messages

4. Code Deletion Criteria
   MUST meet ALL of these conditions:
   - Code is directly causing the bug
   - Code is redundant due to the bug fix
   - Deletion does NOT remove functionality
   - Alternative implementation exists
   
5. Required Documentation
   All changes MUST include:
   - Comment explaining the bug fix
   - Reference to bug ticket/issue number
   - Description of testing performed
   - Explanation if any code was moved

6. Error Handling
   Only modify error handling if:
   - Error case is no longer possible
   - Error is now handled at a different layer
   - Error handling was incorrect
   - New implementation provides better error coverage

7. Examples:
```swift
// Bad: Removing functionality to fix bug
func processVideo() {
    // BAD: Removing validation entirely
    // if !isValidVideo { throw VideoError.invalid }
    processVideoContent()
}

// Good: Fixing bug while maintaining functionality
func processVideo() {
    // Fixed: Issue #123 - Improved validation logic
    // Old: if !isValidVideo { throw VideoError.invalid }
    // New: More specific validation
    if !videoService.validateFormat(video) {
        throw VideoError.invalidFormat
    }
    if !videoService.validateContent(video) {
        throw VideoError.invalidContent
    }
    processVideoContent()
}
```
