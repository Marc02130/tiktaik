# AI Use Cases for Creator Stories

## 1. Recipe Ingredient Detection & Auto-Tagging
**For Chef Creators**

### Overview
AI automatically analyzes cooking videos to detect ingredients, tools, and techniques, then generates accurate tags and metadata.

### Features
- **Visual Ingredient Recognition**
  - Identifies ingredients as they appear in video
  - Generates ingredient list automatically
  - Estimates quantities used

- **Technique Classification**
  - Recognizes cooking methods (chopping, saut√©ing, baking)
  - Identifies kitchen tools being used
  - Estimates preparation time

- **Auto-Metadata Generation** 
  - Creates searchable tags
  - Suggests cuisine categories
  - Identifies dietary considerations (vegetarian, gluten-free)
  - Estimates difficulty level

### Technical Requirements
```swift
struct RecipeAIAnalysis {
    let ingredients: [IngredientDetection]
    let techniques: [CookingTechnique]
    let estimatedTime: TimeInterval
    let suggestedTags: Set<String>
    let dietaryInfo: [DietaryTag]
}

/// Example Usage:
/// ```swift
/// let analysis = await AIService.analyzeRecipeVideo(url: videoURL)
/// video.updateMetadata(from: analysis)
/// ```
```

## 2. Form Analysis & Safety Feedback
**For Exercise Creators**

### Overview
AI analyzes exercise form in videos to provide safety suggestions and automatic categorization of movements.

### Features
- **Movement Analysis**
  - Identifies exercise types
  - Detects key body positions
  - Analyzes form correctness
  - Flags potential safety concerns

- **Auto-Classification**
  - Categorizes by muscle groups
  - Determines difficulty level
  - Identifies required equipment
  - Estimates calorie burn

- **Safety Recommendations**
  - Suggests form improvements
  - Identifies risk factors
  - Generates safety cues
  - Recommends modifications

### Technical Requirements
```swift
struct ExerciseAIAnalysis {
    let movementType: ExerciseCategory
    let muscleGroups: Set<MuscleGroup>
    let formAnalysis: FormSafetyReport
    let difficultyScore: Float
    let safetyRecommendations: [SafetyCue]
}

/// Example Usage:
/// ```swift
/// let analysis = await AIService.analyzeExerciseForm(url: videoURL)
/// video.updateSafetyGuidelines(from: analysis)
/// ```
```
