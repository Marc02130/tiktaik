# Feed Algorithm Technical Requirements - Week 1

## Overview
Basic algorithm to populate video feed based on following status, tags, and a toggle for creator-only content.

## Functional Requirements

### Feed Types
- **Main Feed**
  - Following-based content
  - Tag-based recommendations
  - Toggle for creator-only view

### Creator-Only Toggle
- **Personal Content View**
  - Switch to view only own content
  - Sorted by upload date
  - Include private videos

## Technical Implementation

### Data Models
```swift
struct FeedConfiguration {
    var isCreatorOnly: Bool
    var followingOnly: Bool
    var selectedTags: Set<String>
}

struct FeedQuery {
    let limit: Int
    let lastVideo: Video?
    let config: FeedConfiguration
}

struct VideoMetadata {
    let id: String
    let tags: Set<String>
    let uploadDate: Date
    let isPrivate: Bool
    var viewCount: Int
}
```


## Performance Requirements

### Query Optimization
- Limit: 10 videos per fetch
- Pagination using cursor
- Cache query results
- Preload next batch

### Response Times
- Initial load: < 1 second
- Subsequent loads: < 500ms
- Smooth scrolling: No jank

## Error Handling
- Network connectivity
- Empty results
- Invalid queries
- Rate limiting

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests
- Scoring algorithm
- Query generation
- Filter logic
- Sort ordering

### Integration Tests
- Data fetching
- Feed population
- Toggle functionality
- Pagination

## Dependencies
- Firebase Firestore
- Combine
- SwiftUI

## Future Enhancements
- Advanced recommendation engine
- User preferences
- View time weighting
- Engagement scoring

## Notes
- Start with simple, deterministic algorithm
- Focus on performance and reliability
- Monitor query costs
- Cache aggressively
